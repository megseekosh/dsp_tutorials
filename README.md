This repository contains the notebooks (code+tutorials) and toy data (for practice problems) that constitute an e-book that I wrote:

Cychosz, M. (2024). *Digital Signal Processing for Speech, Language, and Hearing Scientists.* 

## Chapters

### 1. Introduction
Topics covered: *What is DSP?, Reading an audio file into a computer and playing it back, sampling rate, quantization, clipping, mono vs. stereo* 
### 2. Measurement & Manipulation
Topics covered: *Amplitude measurement, conversion, fades, modulation, sound localization, amplitude manipulation*
### 3. Signal Synthesis 
Topics covered: *Synthesizing simple, complex, and aperiodic signals*
### 4. Fourier Transforms 
Topics covered: *Defining the discrete Fourier transform, plotting, inverse discrete Fourier transform, harmonics, leakage, FFT, sampling & FFT*
### 5. Digital Filters 
Topics covered: *Finite impulse response filters, Moving average filters, convolution, low-pass filters, filter order, windowing, band-pass filters, high-pass filters, pre-emphasis, scaling gain* 
### 6. Channel Vocoders 
Bonus chapter that is actually covered in this paper:

Cychosz, M., Winn, M., & Goupell, M. (to appear). How to vocode: Using vocoders for cochlear implant research. *Journal of the Acoustical Society of America* https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/yrqnu

and the affiliated Github repository: https://github.com/ListenLab/Vocoder

## Disclaimer

I'm a trained linguist (not an engineer!). If you find an error, let me know so I can make this resource better! I don't really get any "credit" for this e-book since it's not peer-reviewed-that's not why I wrote it. I just think DSP is super important for students in my field(s), and I hope that my unique path to engineering actually makes me better at explaining some of these concepts. Happy digital signal processing! Enjoy!
