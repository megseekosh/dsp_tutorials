This repository contains the notebooks (code+tutorials) and toy data (for practice problems) that constitute an e-book that I wrote:

Cychosz, M. (2024). *Digital Signal Processing for Speech, Language, and Hearing Scientists.* 

## Chapters

* 1. Introduction: *Tpics covered: What is DSP?, Reading an audio file into a computer and playing it back, sampling rate, quantization, clipping, mono vs. stereo* 
* 2. Measurement & Manipulation: *Topics covered: amplitude measurement, conversion, fades, modulation, sound localization, amplitude manipulation*
* 3. Speech Synthesis *Topics covered: synthesizing simple, complex, and aperiodic signals*
* 4. Fourier Transforms *Topics covered: defining the discrete Fourier transform, plotting, inverse discrete Fourier transform, Harmonics, Leakage, FFT, Sampling & FFT*
* 5. Digital Filters *Topics covered: Finite impulse response filters, Moving average filters, convolution, low-pass filters, filter order, windowing, band-pass filters, high-pass filters, pre-emphasis, scaling gain, speech perception & production filters* 
* 6. Vocoders (bonus chapter that is actually covered in this paper:

 Cychosz, M., Winn, M., & Goupell, M. (to appear). How to vocode: Using vocoders for cochlear implant research. *Journal of the Acoustical Society of America* [https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/yrqnu]
     and the affiliated Github repository: [https://github.com/ListenLab/Vocoder]

Disclaimer: I'm a trained linguist (not an engineer!). If you find an error, let me know so I can make this resource better. I get very little credit for this e-book since it's not peer-reviewed. I just think DSP is super important for people in my field(s), and I hope that my unique path to engineering actually makes me better at explaining some of these concepts. Happy digital dignal processing! Enjoy!
